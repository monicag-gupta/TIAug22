Exercise:
Menu driven Program: (Add Employee, Display List, Exit)
Create a class called Employee that asks the user to input the name and the age of an employee. Prepare a list of employees with the following criteria: 
Raise a custom defined exception when the user enters an employee name that has already been entered in the array/Collection
of employees and raise another exception if the age is negative or less than 18 or greater than 60. If there is any occurrence of any other exception, 
throw those also as user defined exceptions.
We need two custom defined exceptions:
NameException, AgeException
If age <18: “Children are not allowed as Employees”
If Age<0 : “Ghosts are not allowed as Employees”
If age>60: “Seniors are not allowed as Employees”
If age> 100 : “Purvaj are not allowed as Employees”
If name is duplicate: “Duplicate names are not allowed as Employees”














import java.util.*;

public class MenuDrivenArchitecture {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in); // dependent on input from user
		int ch; // declare variables outside the menu
		while (true) { // infinite loop with exit plan
			System.out
					.println("\nMenu\n1. Java \n2. JEE \n3. Hibernate\n4. Exit");
			System.out.println("Enter your skill(1, 2, 3). To exit enter 4");
			ch = sc.nextInt();
			if (ch == 1) {
				System.out.println("Welcome Java Coder");
			} else if (ch == 2) {
				System.out.println("Welcome JEE Coder");
			} else if (ch == 3) {
				System.out.println("Welcome HBM Coder");
			} else if (ch == 4) {
				break;
			} else {
				System.out.println("Bad Choice, Enter Again");
			}
		}
