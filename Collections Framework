The Java Collections Framework consists of:

Collection interfaces : 
  Collection, List, Set, Map, etc.
  
General-purpose implementations : 
  ArrayList, LinkedList, HashSet, HashMap, etc.
  
Special-purpose implementations : 
  designed for performance characteristics, usage restrictions, or behavior: Stack, Queue, etc
  
Concurrent implementations: 
  designed for use in high-concurrency contexts: BlockingQueue, ConcurrentMap
  
Wrapper implementations: 
  adding synchronization, immutability, etc.
  
Abstract implementations: 
  building blocks for custom implementations
  
Algorithms : 
  static methods that perform useful functions, such as sorting or randomizing a collection
  
Infrastructure: 
  interfaces to support the collections
  
Array utilities : 
  static methods that perform useful functions on arrays, such as sorting, initializing, or converting to collections





All collections frameworks contain the following:

Interfaces: 
  These are abstract data types that represent collections. 
  Interfaces allow collections to be manipulated independently of the details of their representation. 
  In object-oriented languages, interfaces generally form a hierarchy.

Implementations, i.e., Classes: 
  These are the concrete implementations of the collection interfaces. 
  In essence, they are reusable data structures.

Algorithms: 
  These are the methods that perform useful computations, such as searching and sorting, on objects that implement collection interfaces. 
  The algorithms are said to be polymorphic: that is, the same method can be used on many different implementations of the appropriate collection interface.
